= Custom strategy

When using a `Custom` strategy, all the defined input secrets and ConfigMaps are available in the builder container in the `/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build` directory. The custom build image must use these secrets and ConfigMaps appropriately. With the `Custom` strategy, you can define secrets as described in Custom Strategy Options.

There is no technical difference between existing strategy secrets and the input secrets. However, your builder image might distinguish between them and use them differently, based on your build use case.

The input secrets are always mounted into the `/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build` directory, or your builder can parse the `$BUILD` environment variable, which includes the full build object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a pull secret for the registry exists in both the namespace and the node, builds default to using the pull secret in the namespace.
