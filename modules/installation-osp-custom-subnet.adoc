[id="installation-osp-custom-subnet_{context}"]
= Custom subnets in {rh-openstack} deployments

Optionally, you can deploy a cluster on a {rh-openstack-first} subnet of your choice. The subnet's GUID is passed as the value of `platform.openstack.machinesSubnet` in the `install-config.yaml` file.

This subnet is used as the cluster's primary subnet; nodes and ports are created on it.

Before you run the {product-title} installer with a custom subnet, verify that:

* The target network and subnet are available.

* DHCP is enabled on the target subnet.

* You can provide installer credentials that have permission to create ports on the target network.

* If your network configuration requires a router, it is created in {rh-openstack}. Some configurations rely on routers for floating IP address translation.

* Your network configuration does not rely on a provider network. Provider networks are not supported.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the API VIP takes x.x.x.5 and the Ingress VIP takes x.x.x.7 from your network's CIDR block. To override these default values,
set values for `platform.openstack.apiVIP` and `platform.openstack.ingressVIP` that are outside of the DHCP allocation pool.
