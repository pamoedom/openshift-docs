= About the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator

The Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) is implemented as an API resource and a custom resource (CR). The CR determines the actions the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator should take with the Pods associated with a specific workload object, such as a Daemonset, ReplicationController, and so forth. 

The VPA automatically computes historic and current CPU and memory usage for the containers in those Pods and can use this data to automatically re-deploy Pods with optimized resource limits and requests to ensure that these Pods are operating efficiently at all times. When re-deploying Pods, the VPA honors any Pod Disruption Budget set for applications. If you do not want the VPA to automatically re-deploy Pods, you can use this resource information to manually update the Pods as needed.

When configured to update Pods automatically, the VPA reduces resources for Pods that are requesting more resources then they are using and increase resources for Pods that are not requesting enough. 

For example, if you have a pod that uses 50% of the CPU but only requests 10%, the VPA determines that the Pod is consuming more CPU than requested and restarts the Pods with higher resources. 

For developers, the VPA helps ensure their Pods stay up during periods of high demand by scheduling Pods onto nodes so that appropriate resources are available for each Pod. 

Administrators can use the VPA to better utilize cluster resources, such as preventing Pods from reserving more CPU resources than needed. The VPA monitors the resources that workloads are actually using and adjusts the resource requirements so capacity is available to other workloads. The VPA also maintains the ratios between limits and requests that are specified in initial container configuration. 

[NOTE]
====
If you stop running the VPA or delete a specific VPA CR in your cluster, the resource requests for the Pods already modified by the VPA do not change. Any new Pods get the resources defined in the workload object, not the previous recommendations made by the VPA.
