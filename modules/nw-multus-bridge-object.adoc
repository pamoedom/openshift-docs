= Configuration for bridge

The configuration for an additional network attachment that uses the bridge
Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in is provided in two parts:

* Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration
* CNI plug-in configuration

The CNO configuration specifies the name for the additional network attachment
and the namespace to create the attachment in. The plug-in
is configured by a JSON object specified by the `rawCNIConfig` parameter in
the CNO configuration.

The following YAML describes the configuration parameters for the CNO:

.Cluster Network Operator YAML configuration
[source,yaml]
----
name: <name> <1>
namespace: <namespace> <2>
rawCNIConfig: '{ <3>
  ...
}'
type: Raw
----
<1> Specify a name for the additional network attachment that you are
creating. The name must be unique within the specified `namespace`.

<2> Specify the namespace to create the network attachment in. If
you do not specify a value, then the `default` namespace is used.

<3> Specify the CNI plug-in configuration in JSON format, which
is based on the following template.

The following object describes the configuration parameters for the bridge CNI
plug-in:

.bridge CNI plug-in JSON configuration object
[source,json]
----
{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "<name>", <1>
  "type": "bridge",
  "bridge": "<bridge>", <2>
  "ipam": { <3>
    ...
  },
  "ipMasq": false, <4>
  "isGateway": false, <5>
  "isDefaultGateway": false, <6>
  "forceAddress": false, <7>
  "hairpinMode": false, <8>
  "promiscMode": false, <9>
  "vlan": <vlan>, <10>
  "mtu": <mtu> <11>
}
----
<1> Specify the value for the `name` parameter you provided previously for
the CNO configuration.

<2> Specify the name of the virtual bridge to use. If the bridge
interface does not exist on the host, it is created. The default value is
`cni0`.

<3> Specify a configuration object for the ipam CNI plug-in. The plug-in
manages IP address assignment for the network attachment definition.

<4> Set to `true` to enable IP masquerading for traffic that leaves the
virtual network. The source IP address for all traffic is rewritten to the
bridge's IP address. If the bridge does not have an IP address, this setting has
no effect. The default value is `false`.

<5> Set to `true` to assign an IP address to the bridge. The
default value is `false`.

<6> Set to `true` to configure the bridge as the default
gateway for the virtual network. The default value is `false`. If
`isDefaultGateway` is set to `true`, then `isGateway` is also set to `true`
automatically.

<7> Set to `true` to allow assignment of a previously assigned
IP address to the virtual bridge. When set to `false`, if an IPv4 address or an
IPv6 address from overlapping subsets is assigned to the virtual bridge, an
error occurs. The default value is `false`.

<8> Set to `true` to allow the virtual bridge to send an ethernet
frame back through the virtual port it was received on. This mode is also known
as _reflective relay_. The default value is `false`.

<9> Set to `true` to enable promiscuous mode on the bridge. The
default value is `false`.

<10> Specify a virtual LAN (VLAN) tag as an integer value. By default,
no VLAN tag is assigned.

<11> Set the maximum transmission unit (MTU) to the specified value. The
default value is automatically set by the kernel.

== bridge configuration example

The following example configures an additional network named `bridge-net`:

[source,yaml]
----
name: bridge-net
namespace: work-network
type: Raw
rawCNIConfig: '{ <1>
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "work-network",

  "isGateway": true,
  "vlan": 2,
  "ipam": {
    "type": "dhcp"
    }
}'
----
<1> The CNI configuration object is specified as a YAML string.
