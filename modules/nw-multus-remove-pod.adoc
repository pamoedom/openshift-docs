= Removing a Pod from an additional network

You can remove a Pod from an additional network.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured an additional network for your cluster.
* You have an additional network attached to the Pod.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You must log in to the cluster.

.Procedure

To remove a Pod from an additional network, complete the following steps:

. Edit the Pod resource definition by running the following command. Replace
`<name>` with the name of the Pod to edit.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit pod <name>
----

. Update the `annotations` mapping to remove the additional network from the
Pod by performing one of the following actions:

* To remove all additional networks from a Pod, remove the
`k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` parameter from the Pod resource definition as in
the following example:
+
[source,yaml] 
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
  annotations: {}
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-pod
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 2000000000000"]
    image: centos/tools
----

* To remove a specific additional network from a Pod, update the
`k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` parameter by removing the name of the
NetworkAttachmentDefinition for the additional network.

. Optional: Confirm that the Pod is no longer attached to the additional network
by running the following command. Replace `<name>` with the name of the Pod.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pod <name>
----
+
In the following example, the `example-pod` Pod is attached only to the default
cluster network.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pod example-pod
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Name:               example-pod
