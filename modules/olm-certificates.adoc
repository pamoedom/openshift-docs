== Management

All certificates for OpenShift Lifecycle Manager (OLM) components
(`olm-operator`, `catalog-operator`, `packageserver`, and
`marketplace-operator`) are managed by the system.

Operators installed via OLM can have certificates generated for them if they are
providing API services. `packageserver` is one example.

Certificates in the `openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager` namespace are managed
by OLM with the exception of certificates used by Operators that require a
validating or mutating webhook.

Operators that install validating or mutating webhooks must currently manage
those certificates themselves. They do not require the user to manage the
certificates.

OLM will not update the certificates of Operators that it manages in proxy
environments. These certificates must be managed by the user via the
subscription config.
