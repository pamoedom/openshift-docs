= Understanding your API services

As with CRDs, there are two types of APIServices that your Operator may use:
_owned_ and _required_.

[id="osdk-apiservices-owned_{context}"]
== Owned APIServices

When a CSV owns an APIService, it is responsible for describing the deployment
of the extension `api-server` that backs it and the `group-version-kinds` it
provides.

An APIService is uniquely identified by the `group-version` it provides and can
be listed multiple times to denote the different kinds it is expected to
provide.

.Owned APIService fields
[cols="2a,5a,2",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description |Required/Optional

|`Group`
|Group that the APIService provides, for example `database.example.com`.
|Required

|`Version`
|Version of the APIService, for example `v1alpha1`.
|Required

|`Kind`
|A kind that the APIService is expected to provide.
|Required

|`Name`
|The plural name for the APIService provided
|Required

|`DeploymentName`
|Name of the deployment defined by your CSV that corresponds to your APIService
(required for owned APIServices). During the CSV pending phase, the OLM Operator
searches the InstallStrategy of your CSV for a Deployment spec with a matching
name, and if not found, does not transition the CSV to the install ready phase.
|Required

|`DisplayName`
|A human readable version of your APIService name, for example `MongoDB Standalone`.
|Required

|`Description`
|A short description of how this APIService is used by the Operator or a
description of the functionality provided by the APIService.
|Required

|`Resources`
a|Your APIServices own one or more types of Kubernetes objects. These are listed
in the resources section to inform your users of the objects they might need to
troubleshoot or how to connect to the application, such as the Service or
Ingress rule that exposes a database.

It is recommended to only list out the objects that are important to a human,
not an exhaustive list of everything you orchestrate. For example, ConfigMaps
that store internal state that should not be modified by a user should not
appear here.
|Optional

|`SpecDescriptors`, `StatusDescriptors`, and `ActionDescriptors`
|Essentially the same as for owned CRDs.
|Optional

[id="osdk-apiservices-resource-creation_{context}"]
=== APIService Resource Creation

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) is responsible for creating or replacing
the Service and APIService resources for each unique owned APIService:

* Service Pod selectors are copied from the CSV deployment matching the
APIServiceDescription's `DeploymentName`.

* A new CA key/cert pair is generated for each installation and the
base64-encoded CA bundle is embedded in the respective APIService resource.

[id="osdk-apiservices-service-certs_{context}"]
=== APIService Serving Certs

OLM handles generating a serving key/cert pair whenever an owned APIService
is being installed. The serving certificate has a CN containing the host name of
the generated Service resource and is signed by the private key of the CA bundle
embedded in the corresponding APIService resource.

The cert is stored as a type `kubernetes.io/tls` Secret in the deployment
namespace, and a Volume named `apiservice-cert` is automatically appended to the
Volumes section of the deployment in the CSV matching the
APIServiceDescription's `DeploymentName` field.

If one does not already exist, a VolumeMount with a matching name is also
appended to all containers of that deployment. This allows users to define a
VolumeMount with the expected name to accommodate any custom path requirements.
The generated VolumeMount's path defaults to
`/apiserver.local.config/certificates` and any existing VolumeMounts with the
same path are replaced.

[id="osdk-apiservice-required_{context}"]
== Required APIServices

OLM ensures all required CSVs have an APIService that is available and all
expected `group-version-kinds` are discoverable before attempting installation.
This allows a CSV to rely on specific kinds provided by APIServices it does not
own.
