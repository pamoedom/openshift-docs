= Recommended etcd practices

For large and dense clusters, etcd can suffer from poor performance
if the keyspace grows excessively large and exceeds the space quota.
Periodic maintenance of etcd, including defragmentation, must be performed
to free up space in the data store. It is highly recommended that you monitor
Prometheus for etcd metrics and defragment it when required before etcd raises
a cluster-wide alarm that puts the cluster into a maintenance mode, which
only accepts key reads and deletes. Some of the key metrics to monitor are
`etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes` which is the current quota limit,
`etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes` which indicates the actual
database usage after a history compaction, and
`etcd_debugging_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes` which shows the database size
including free space waiting for defragmentation.
