[id="serverless-deleting-broker-admin_{context}"]
= Deleting a broker that was created by a cluster administrator using namespace annotation

Brokers created due to annotation will not be removed if you remove the annotation. You must manually delete them.

.Procedure

. Remove the injection annotation from the namespace:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace <namespace> eventing.knative.dev/injection-
----
+
Removing the annotation prevents the broker from being automatically recreated after you delete it.

. Delete the injected broker from the selected namespace:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <namespace> delete broker <broker_name>
----
