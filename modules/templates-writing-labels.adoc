= Writing template labels

Templates can include a set of labels. These labels will be added to each object
created when the template is instantiated. Defining a label in this way makes it
easy for users to find and manage all the objects created from a particular
template.

The following is an example of template object labels:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: "Template"
apiVersion: "v1"
...
labels:
  template: "cakephp-mysql-example" <1>
  app: "${NAME}" <2>
----
<1> A label that will be applied to all objects created from this template.
<2> A parameterized label that will also be applied to all objects created from
this template.  Parameter expansion is carried out on both label keys and
values.
