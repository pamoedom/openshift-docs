= Writing the template object list

The main portion of the template is the list of objects which will be created
when the template is instantiated. This can be any valid API object, such as a
`BuildConfig`, `DeploymentConfig`, `Service`, etc. The object will be
created exactly as defined here, with any parameter values substituted in prior
to creation. The definition of these objects can reference parameters defined
earlier.

The following is an example of an object list:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: "Template"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: my-template
objects:
  - kind: "Service" <1>
    apiVersion: "v1"
    metadata:
      name: "cakephp-mysql-example"
      annotations:
        description: "Exposes and load balances the application pods"
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: "web"
          port: 8080
          targetPort: 8080
      selector:
        name: "cakephp-mysql-example"
----
<1> The definition of a `Service` which will be created by this template.


[NOTE]
====
If an object definition's metadata includes a fixed `namespace` field value, the
field will be stripped out of the definition during template instantiation. If
the `namespace` field contains a parameter reference, normal parameter
substitution will be performed and the object will be created in whatever
namespace the parameter substitution resolved the value to, assuming the user
has permission to create objects in that namespace.
