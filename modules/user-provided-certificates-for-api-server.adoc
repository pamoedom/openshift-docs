= User-provided certificates for the API server

[discrete]
== Purpose

The API server is accessible by clients external to the cluster at
`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`. You might want clients to access the API
server at a different host name or without the need to distribute the
cluster-managed certificate authority (CA) certificates to the clients. The
administrator must set a custom default certificate to be used by the API server
when serving content.

[discrete]
== Location

The user-provided certificates must be provided in a `kubernetes.io/tls` type
`Secret` in the `openshift-config` namespace. Update the API server cluster
configuration, the `apiserver/cluster` resource, to enable the use of the
user-provided certificate.

[discrete]
== Management

User-provided certificates are managed by the user.

[discrete]
== Expiration

User-provided certificates are managed by the user.

[discrete]
== Customization

Update the secret containing the user-managed certificate as needed.
