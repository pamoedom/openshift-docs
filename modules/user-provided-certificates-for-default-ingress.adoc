= User-provided certificates for default ingress

[discrete]
== Purpose

Applications are usually exposed at
`<route_name>.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`. The `<cluster_name>` and
`<base_domain>` come from the installation config file. `<route_name>` is the
host field of the route, if specified, or the route name. For example,
`hello-openshift-default.apps.username.devcluster.openshift.com`.
`hello-openshift` is the name of the route and the route is in the default
namespace. You might want clients to access the applications without the need to
distribute the cluster-managed CA certificates to the clients. The administrator
must set a custom default certificate when serving application content.

[WARNING]
====
The Ingress Operator generates a default certificate for an Ingress Controller
to serve as a placeholder until you configure a custom default certificate. Do
not use operator-generated default certificates in production clusters.

[discrete]
== Location

The user-provided certificates must be provided in a `kubernetes.io/tls` type
`Secret` in the `openshift-config` namespace. Update the
`ingresscontroller.operator/default` resource in the
`openshift-ingress-operator` namespace to enable the use of the user-provided
certificate.

[discrete]
== Management

User-provided certificates are managed by the user.

[discrete]
== Expiration

User-provided certificates are managed by the user.

[discrete]
== Services

Applications deployed on the cluster use user-provided certificates for default
ingress.

[discrete]
== Customization

Update the secret containing the user-managed certificate as needed.
