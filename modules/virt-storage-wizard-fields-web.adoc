To select an existing disk and attach it to the virtual machine, choose *Attach Cloned Disk* or *Attach Disk* from a list of available PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).

|Name
|Name of the disk. The name can contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), hyphens (`-`), and periods (`.`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, or special characters.

|Size (GiB)
|Size, in GiB, of the disk.

|Interface
|Type of disk device. Supported interfaces are *virtIO*, *SATA*, and *SCSI*.

|Storage Class
|The `StorageClass` that is used to create the disk.

|Advanced -> Volume Mode

.2+|Volume Mode
|Filesystem
|Stores the virtual disk on a filesystem-based volume.

|Block
|Stores the virtual disk directly on the block volume. Only use `Block` if the underlying storage supports it.

|Single User (RWO)
|The disk can be mounted as read/write by a single node.

|Shared Access (RWX)
|The disk can be mounted as read/write by many nodes.
[NOTE]
====
This is required for some features, such as live migration of virtual machines between nodes.
====

|Read Only (ROX)
|The disk can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
