= Understanding smart-cloning

Smart-cloning creates a clone of a DataVolume using the most efficient method available,
either by snapshot or host-assisted cloning.

When a DataVolume is smart-cloned, the following occurs:

. A snapshot of the source PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is created.
. A PVC is created from the snapshot.
. The snapshot is deleted.
