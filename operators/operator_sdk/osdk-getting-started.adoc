This guide outlines the basics of the Operator SDK and walks Operator authors
with cluster administrator access to a Kubernetes-based cluster (such as
{product-title}) through an example of building a simple Go-based Memcached
Operator and managing its lifecycle from installation to upgrade.

This is accomplished using two centerpieces of the Operator Framework:
Operator SDK (the `operator-sdk` CLI tool and `controller-runtime` library API)
and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} 4.4 supports Operator SDK v0.15.0 or later.

== Getting involved

This guide provides an effective demonstration of the value of the Operator
Framework for building and managing Operators, but this is much more left out in
the interest of brevity. The Operator Framework and its components are open
source, so visit each project individually and learn what else you can do:
