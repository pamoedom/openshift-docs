Events can be sent from a source to a sink by using channels and subscriptions for event delivery.

// just sources or do we need to talk about other event producers?

Channels are custom resources that define a single event-forwarding and persistence layer.

After events have been sent to a channel, these events can be sent to multiple Knative services, or other sinks, by using a subscription.

Developers can create their own channels directly by instantiating a supported `Channel` object.
