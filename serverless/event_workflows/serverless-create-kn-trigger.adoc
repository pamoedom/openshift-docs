= Creating a trigger using `kn`

All events that are sent to a broker will be sent to all of the subscribers of that broker by default.

Using triggers allows you to filter events from a broker, so that subscribers will only receive a subset of events based on your defined criteria.

The Knative CLI provides a set of `kn trigger` commands that can be used to create and manage triggers.

.Procedure

* Create a trigger:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn trigger create <trigger_name> --broker <broker_name> --filter <key=value> --sink <sink_name>
----

+
Alternatively, you can create a trigger and simultaneously create the `default` broker using broker injection:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn trigger create <trigger_name> --inject-broker --filter <key=value> --sink <sink_name>
----
