Events are sent from an event source to your broker as an HTTP POST request.
After events have entered the broker they can be filtered by event attributes, and sent as an HTTP POST request to an event sink by using triggers.

You can create the `default` broker by using the `knative-eventing-injection` annotation.

[NOTE]
====
Although both developers and cluster administrators can add the `knative-eventing-injection` annotation, only cluster administrators can remove brokers created using this annotation.

== Using triggers

You can create triggers using YAML, as shown in the following example:

.Example trigger YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: trigger-example <1>
spec:
 broker: default <2>
 subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: my-service <3>
----

<1> The name of the trigger.
<2> The name of the broker where events will be filtered from. If the broker is not specified, the trigger will revert to using the `default` broker.
<3> The name of the service that will consumer filtered events.

However, the Knative CLI (`kn`) provides the following commands to simplify creating and managing triggers.
